# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I like its simplicity and so far it doesnt really seem much different from java other than having less restrictions. Its like writing in math vs in english the math teacher doesnt care about our grammar.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

I think that a lot of the built in functions are very simmilat. indidation is always a good idea regardless of its importance. All programming languages I have used have some of the same basic function. def variables function for loops iterating and all that stuff have been very simmilar

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned a lot about lists creating functions iterating doing math in the console. Making comments, staying organized, indenting properley. I have already refreshed and learned a lot through this assigment.
